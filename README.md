# Algebraic-Reconstruction-Technique---MIC

This project is a MATLAB implementation of the variants of ART, a popular CT Image reconstruction problem. 

We explore the following 3 variants of ART (Additive, Multiplicative and Simultaneous) and perform comparisons in the results of the reconstructed image compared with the original image, whose Radon Transform we had acquired. We have experimented on 2 test images, the phantom image and a Brain MRI image. The reported values are the RRMSE i.e. the relative Root mean squared value. We also have results for the various different parameters available in the algorithm.
